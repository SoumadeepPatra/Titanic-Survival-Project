# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.
It is one of the most popular beginner projects for learning data analysis and classification modeling.

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details about Titanic passengers, such as:

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex: Gender

Age: Age of passenger

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Fare: Ticket fare

Cabin: Cabin number

Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

# 🛠️ Project Workflow
Data Loading – Import the dataset and explore its structure.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove irrelevant features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize patterns and relationships between features and survival.

Feature Engineering – Create new features (e.g., Title from Name, Family Size).

Model Building – Train various classification algorithms such as:

Model Evaluation – Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Prediction – Generate survival predictions for new passenger data.

# 📊 Key Insights
Gender and Passenger Class were strong predictors of survival.

Younger passengers and those in higher classes had better survival chances.

Certain family groupings increased the likelihood of survival.

# 🧰 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

Git/GitHub for version control

# 🎯 Goal
The aim of this project is to:

Learn and practice the end-to-end machine learning workflow

Understand data preprocessing and feature engineering

Build, evaluate, and compare classification models
